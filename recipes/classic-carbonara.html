        Description
    </h2>
    <p>This is the classic version of pancetta carbonara I grew up eating. Serve it piping hot, tossed with extra
        Parmesan cheese and chopped Italian parsley.</p>
    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>½ pound sliced pancetta, chopped</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>½ cup pine nuts, toasted</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped Italian flat leaf parsley</li>
        <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Whisk together eggs, cream, and 1 cup Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Set aside.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta; cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes.
                Drain
                pasta; return it to the pot off heat and cover to keep warm.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent,
                about 8
                minutes. Transfer onion to a bowl; cover to keep warm.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Cook pancetta in the same skillet over medium heat until browned; toss with nutmeg. Drain on paper
                towels.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Combine pasta, onion, pancetta, pine nuts, salt, and pepper in the same large skillet over low heat.
                Slowly stir
                in egg mixture, tossing gently, so eggs don't scramble. Cook until just heated through.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Remove from heat and toss with parsley and remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
